# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Undertale Sans boss fight

## Needs to have list
- heart function properly when being attacked
    - stop moving when hitting a boarder or platform
    - take damage at the right time
- bones function properly
    - float around as intended
    - know if it is on top of the heart
- self made gravity fpr jumping of the boarders
- imitate at least 3 different attacks from the game as close as possible. These attacks being:
    - boneTab 1,2,3
    - blueBone 1
    - boneGap 1,2,3
- very simple death screen

## Nice to Have List
- adjust to full screen
- sound effect when hit
- have all of the attacks from the game:
    - BoneSlideHorizontal
    - BoneSlideVertical
    - Intro
    - Final
    - multi
        -
        -
        -
    - platformBlaster 1,2
- have different game modes
- have different action option
- ok death screen
- diagonal bones
- complex sound effect
- blue bone
- floating platform
    - right inertia for the platform
    - cancels gravity at the right time
    - semi-transparent able to jumpthough from under but not above
- smooth curve for the heart
- load sound faster using promise

## Probably not
- Sans pixel art animation
- heart break animation at death
- bones image
- save and load
- most likely not but smoothly falling off of a random curve with gavity animation
