# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Undertale Sans boss fight

## Needs to have list
- adjust to full screen
- heart function properly when being attacked
    - No going into platforms
    - take damage at the right time
- bones function properly
    - float around in the intended
    - know if it is on top of the heart
- self made gravity. I know this is hard.
- imitate at least 3 different attacks from the game as close as possible
- sound effect when hit
- bad death screen

## Nice to Have List
- have all of the attacks from the game
- have different game modes
- have different action option
- ok death screen
- diagonal bones
- complex sound effect
- blue bone
- floating platform
    - right inertia for the platform
    - cancels gravity at the right time
    - semi-transparent able to jumpthough from under but not above
- smooth curve

## Probably not
- Sans pixel art animation
- heart break animation at death
- bones image
- save and load
- most likely not but smoothly falling off of a random curve with gavity animation
