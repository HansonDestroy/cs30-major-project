Undertale Expert(I forgot to ask his name but turns out he knows the original source code better than I do):
    - biggest advice. Chnage the bone hitbox to the accurate hit box
    - the damage is one tic per second
    - add karma damage(this is easy to impliment but unless you are an experienced player you are not going to tell the difference so for Mr.Schellenberg why bother)
    - add bleed(I still don't know how bleed work)
    - gaster blaster(This is on my todo list)
    - more accurate speed

Computer Science guy(Seth who also plays undertale)
    - add more attacks
    - stop the mulitple click to activate music more than once bug
    - fix the blue bone bug(Ok so I need to explain this in the original game blue bone won't deal damage if you are not moving but in my code blue bone doesn't deal damage as long as you are not pressing any button which usually means you are not moving but not always because of gravity but I don't know if I have a easy way of fixing this bug)
    - condense code(I'm trying okay)
    - add a good instruction button and death screen(never. I refuse)
